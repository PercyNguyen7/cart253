# Artist's statement

Propose Day 2, the sequel to Proposal Day 1 offers a comedic narrative through a variety of interesting minigames. I tried to incorporate elements from the story into the minigames and advancing the plot.

One of the goal was to balance out the difficulty to provide a fun and challenging experience for users. There is also a little twist at the end for players who successfully complete the rejection path.

Due to time constraint, I unfortunately do not have the opportunity to create silly illustrations for Proposal Day 2 as in Proposal Day 1 which would have given more characters to the story. 

However, on the good side, I have managed to focus more on the coding aspect of the game and improved my codes comparing to project 1. The sound design was also taken into great consideration given the overall aesthetic design of the story is based around jazz music. Multiple color palettes and fonts were considered and tested to make up for the lack of illustrations.
